Do not rely on viewport dimensions, becuase this makes things scale weirdly
make sure to implement md: and sm: 
perhaps use [rem] for scaling

make sure every div scales well

perhaps remove the sidebar? not really needed, plus allows bigger space for posts

i like the menu div thing

use grid more
